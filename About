OpenEdX Kubernetes Technical Assessment
Mandatory Clarification
1. Purpose of This Document
This document serves as an official clarification to the OpenEdX Kubernetes Technical Assessment. The requirements outlined below are mandatory and must be addressed in all submissions.
2. Assessment Intent
The objective of this assessment is not limited to deploying OpenEdX on Kubernetes.
The primary intent is to evaluate a candidate’s ability to design and implement a production-grade, cloud-native OpenEdX architecture, with specific focus on:
Data persistence
Database compatibility
High availability
Horizontal scalability
A deployment that functions but does not meet these architectural requirements will not be considered production-ready.
3. Stateless vs Stateful Architecture
By default, OpenEdX deployed using Tutor on Kubernetes follows a largely stateless architecture.
While stateless application components are acceptable in production, data services are not. All databases and stateful components must be designed to persist data reliably across pod restarts, rescheduling, and infrastructure failures.

4. Mandatory Data Persistence Strategy
4.1 Use of Cloud-Native Managed Data Services
You must use cloud-native, managed data services wherever the managed service provides:
The same database engine, and
Full database API compatibility
Examples include (but are not limited to):
MySQL with a cloud-native managed MySQL service
Redis with a cloud-native managed Redis service
These services are expected to provide durability, availability, and operational reliability consistent with production environments.

4.2 Handling Database Compatibility Limitations
If a cloud-native managed service does not provide full database engine or API compatibility, that service must not be used.
For example:
MongoDB is not fully compatible with AWS DocumentDB
MongoDB is not fully compatible with Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)
In such cases, the database must be deployed inside the Kubernetes cluster.

5. In-Cluster Stateful Database Requirements
When deploying databases inside the Kubernetes cluster, the following are mandatory:
Use of StatefulSets
Use of PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
Durable storage backed by reliable cloud storage
Data persistence across pod restarts, rescheduling, and node failures
Running databases as ephemeral pods, or without persistent storage, is not acceptable for this assessment.
6. Scaling and High Availability Expectations
The OpenEdX application layer must be capable of scaling predictably under increased load.
This includes:
Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for stateless application components
Properly defined resource requests and limits
Readiness and liveness probes aligned with scaling behavior
Scaling must not compromise data consistency, integrity, or system stability.
7. Evaluation Impact
The persistence and scaling requirements described in this document represent the core architectural challenge of the assessment.
Failure to clearly address these requirements may result in:
Classification of the solution as non-production-ready
Significant evaluation impact
Disqualification from final consideration, regardless of partial functionality
8. Final Note
Candidates are expected to demonstrate sound architectural judgment, not just installation success.
All submissions should clearly reflect compliance with the requirements outlined in this document.

Technical Assessment for Al Nafi Devops department
🚀 We’re Hiring: OpenEdX on Kubernetes (AWS EKS) | Global Permanent Role (Onsite / Remote)
Location: Global (Remote or Onsite)
Employment Type: Permanent
Hiring Model: Direct Hiring via Technical Assessment
Cloud Platform: AWS ONLY

At Al Nafi, we are entering a decisive global expansion phase. As part of our 2026 global hiring blitz, we are opening 2,000+ permanent roles, covering 36+ core sectors and hundreds of specialized fields worldwide.

This post marks the official starting point of that expansion.

We are looking for professionals who can deliver production-grade platforms on AWS, demonstrate architectural clarity, and operate with enterprise discipline.

🧪 Mandatory Hiring Test
Technical Assessment: OpenEdX Deployment on Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
This task is a mandatory hiring test.
It is designed to evaluate real execution capability, not theoretical knowledge.

This assessment is used for hiring across:

DevOps Engineering
Platform Engineering
Cloud Architecture
SRE
Infrastructure Engineering
🎯 Objective
Deploy a production-ready OpenEdX Learning Management System on AWS EKS, following enterprise-grade architecture, security, scalability, and observability standards.

⚠️ Important:

External Database Services (Mandatory & Offloaded)
All data services must be external to the Kubernetes cluster (AWS managed services or dedicated EC2 instances):

MySQL – Relational database for OpenEdX application data
MongoDB – Document store for course and user data
Elasticsearch – Search and analytics engine
Redis – In-memory cache and message broker
Databases must not run inside Kubernetes.

Web Server & Traffic Management
Replace default Caddy server with Nginx
Configure Nginx as reverse proxy for OpenEdX services
SSL/TLS termination at Nginx level
